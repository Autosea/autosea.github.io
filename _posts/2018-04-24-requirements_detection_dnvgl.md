An autonomous ship navigation system needs to detect and classify objects relevant to the safe navigation of the ship. The distance at which the objects must be detected will depend on the speed and maneuverability of the ship itself as well as the speed and maneuverability of the detected object.  The safe distance for object detection will therefore be dynamic. In order to explore the topic of safe detection range the project is divided in four.

1.    Discuss the rationale for setting the safe detection range for various objects.
2.    Discuss methods and data required for estimating the speed and maneuverability of the ship.
3.    Discuss methods and data required for estimating the behavior of the detected object.
4.    Discuss how environmental conditions can affect the detection range, and how this can be accounted for to ensure safe navigation of the ship.
