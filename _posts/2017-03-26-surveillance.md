title: Surveillance of the Canal
category: SF

## Background
Researchers at NTNU are currently developing an autonomous ferry designed for carrying pedestrians and cyclists between Ravnkloa and Brattøra. The development of a robust collision avoidance system for this ferry will benefit from a thorough analysis of traffic patterns in the canal. For this purpose a radar and a camera has been placed at Ravnkloa.

## Scope
The goal of this project is to provide an analysis of the traffic in the Canal, by accessing data recorded by this system.

## Proposed Tasks
1. Implement a detector for extracting measurements of surface vessels in radar and/or camera data from the sensor station at Ravnkloa.
2. Implement a tracking method in order to keep track of how different vessels in the Canal move.
3. Generate statistics concerning how many vessels there are at different times of the day or the week, what are the most common routes/maneuvers, etc.
4. Write report.


The project work aims to be extended into a master thesis for the spring of 2018. Depending on the interest of the students, there are several possibilities for this extension:
- More elaborate statistical analysis of the observations.
- Additional measurements with other sensors.
- Development of a sensor fusion system for collision avoidance that utilizes data from the stationary sensor station, together with other sensors onboard the ferry. 


## Autosea
The candidate will be associated with the AUTOSEA project, which is a collaborative research project between NTNU, DNV GL, Kongsberg Maritime and Maritime Robotics, focused on achieving world-leading competence and knowledge in the design and verification of methods and systems for sensor fusion and COLAV for ASVs. The project has access to supervision and physical test platforms through our industry partners.
