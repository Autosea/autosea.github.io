title: Obstacle movement prediction for ASV collision avoidance
category: COLAV
---
Autonomous technology is spreading across numerous applications at an unprecedented pace. Amongst others, the DARPA Grand Challenge for autonomous ground vehicles has given an indication of what is possible to achieve using state-of-the-art sensors in combination with cleverly designed autonomous algorithms. We believe the increasing use of autonomy in vehicle systems eventually will propagate to the maritime industry and that we will see an increasing level of autonomy on ships in order to increase safety, and to reduce operational costs, emissions and impacts from human-induced errors.

When operating autonomously at sea, a collision avoidance (COLAV) system must be able to tackle the dangers imposed by other vessels operating in the same area. To avoid moving obstacles, one must have an idea about the future positions of these obstacles. A common approach is to assume that other vessels will keep their course and speed, and calculate a straight-line trajectory based on this assumption. This approach may, however, prove insufficient in some scenarios. By considering previous positions, electronic nautical charts, historical and/or real-time AIS (automatic identification system) data, traffic lanes etc., better estimates can often be obtained. This project will look into alternative solutions based on such data.

This proposal is intended as a combined project and master thesis.

| Electronic charts contains large amount of static information, which can be usable for predicting future vessel positions. | | AIS data can give additional information about both historical trajectories, and current intentions of other vessels. |

## Proposed Tasks
**For the project assignment, the following tasks are proposed:**

1. Write a survey of possible techniques for long and short-term obstacle trajectory prediction. The candidate should also get an overview of the international regulations for avoiding collision at sea (COLREGS) and some suitable COLAV algorithms.
2. Define a suitable parameterization for obstacle trajectories.
3. Implement a simulation framework with moving obstacles in 3 DOF.
4. Look into using information from electronic nautical charts to impose constraints on the predicted trajectories.

**For the master thesis, the following tasks are proposed:**

1. Use historical AIS data to provide further refinement to the prediction technique.
2. Is real-time AIS data useful (and reliable) to impose further constraints on the prediction?
3. Use the proposed prediction technique and parameterization to predict trajectories for moving obstacles.
4. Use the predicted trajectories as input to a COLAV algorithm, and compare the performance with the approach of assuming constant course and speed.

## Autosea
The candidate will be associated with the AUTOSEA project, which is a collaborative research project between NTNU, DNV GL, Kongsberg Maritime and Maritime Robotics, focused on achieving world-leading competence and knowledge in the design and verification of methods and systems for sensor fusion and COLAV for ASVs. The project has access to supervision and physical test platforms through our industry partners.
